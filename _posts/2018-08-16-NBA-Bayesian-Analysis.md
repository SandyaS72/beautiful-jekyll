The [50-40-90 Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50%E2%80%9340%E2%80%9390_club) is an elite distinction for basketball players who make 50% of field goal attempts, 40% of three point attempts, and 90% of free throw attempts over the course of an NBA season (with a minimum of 300 field goals, 82 three pointers, and 125 free throws made) intended to capture the best players of all time. As a representation of just how exclusive the club is, **50-40-90 seasons have only been accomplished eleven times** by seven different players over the course of nearly 40 years since the three point field goal was introduced.
